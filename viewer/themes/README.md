# Theme system — `viewer/themes/`

The entire look of FreedomFromSNS is driven by **design tokens** (CSS custom
properties). A **theme is one JSON file** in this folder that sets those tokens;
the whole stylesheet flows from them, so a single file repaints everything.
Pick a theme from the 🎨 menu in the filter bar (a swatch + name per theme;
the choice persists). Add a theme by dropping a `.json` here — no code, no
restart.

**Shipped set (34):**
- `00-default` **Gold Noir** (dark).
- **5 light themes** (`01`–`05`) matching real current light UIs of major sites:
  Primary Pop (Google), Amber Linen (Amazon), Sapphire Mist (Facebook),
  Scarlet Paper (YouTube), Electric Violet (Yahoo). These are the **light**
  themes — white/near-white surfaces, dark text, the site's accent.
- 2 from reference images: Mocha Mousse, Neon.
- 10 from Framer's *10 elegant palettes*: Earth Tones, Vibrant Greens, Warm
  Neutrals, Maroon Mood, Bold Orange, Cool Blues, Minimal, Pastels, Vibrant
  Blues, Power Purple.
- 16 from a palette gallery: Morning Sky, Burgundy Rose, Cocoa Lime, Barn Sage,
  Cerulean, Evergreen, Jade Mist, Toffee, Coral Reef, Dusty Indigo, Tropical
  Punch, Harvest, Deep Ocean, Pop Art, Dusty Dune, Espresso.

The dark themes are interpretations — each takes its palette's signature color
as the accent and tunes the base/surfaces to that hue. A **light theme must be
a full token set** (it inverts surfaces + text), and should flip `hi-rgb` to
`0,0,0` so the faint overlays darken instead of lighten — see `01-primary-pop`
for the template.

## How it works

1. `viewer/fb-app.css` defines the **default values** of every token in `:root`
   (the "Gold Noir" look) and uses **only** those tokens everywhere. With JS
   off, the default theme still renders.
2. `fbbackup/ffs_server.py` → `home()` scans `viewer/themes/*.json` (sorted by
   filename, so `00-default` is first), and injects them as
   `window.FFS.themes = [{name, tokens}, …]`.
3. A tiny `<head>` script in `index.html` applies the **persisted** theme before
   first paint (no flash). `fb-app.js` (`applyTheme` / `setTheme`) handles
   switching at runtime: it **clears all theme-set `:root` properties, then
   applies the chosen theme** — so a theme file may be **partial** (list only
   the tokens it changes; the rest fall back to the CSS `:root` default).
4. The chosen index is remembered in `localStorage["ffs.theme"]`.

## Theme file format

```jsonc
{
  "name": "Emerald",          // shown in the 🎨 tooltip
  "tokens": {                 // bare token names (no leading --); applied as :root vars
    "gold": "#2dd4a7",
    "gold-rgb": "45,212,167",
    "accent": "#5eead4",
    "on-accent": "#04130d"
  }
}
```

- **Order:** files are sorted by filename; prefix `00-`, `01-`, … to control the
  cycle order. `00-default.json` should stay first (it's the full reference).
- **Partial vs full:** `00-default.json` lists every token (the canonical
  reference). Variant themes only need the tokens they override.

## Token reference

Colors are hex; the `*-rgb` tokens are **`R,G,B` triples** (no `rgb()` wrapper)
so tints and shadows — written `rgba(var(--x-rgb), a)` — re-tint with the theme.

| Token | Role |
|---|---|
| `bg`, `bg-rgb` | page background (rgb form used for the sticky header scrim) |
| `bg2` | cards, bubbles, raised surfaces |
| `bg3` | inputs, chips, controls |
| `line` | borders / dividers |
| `shadow-rgb` | drop shadows + modal scrims (`0,0,0` on dark themes) |
| `hi-rgb` | faint light overlays (even-row tint, etc.) |
| `txt` | body text |
| `fg` | slightly brighter text (controls, hovers) |
| `fg-bright` | strongest text (hover headings) — usually white |
| `dim` | secondary text |
| `faint` | tertiary text (dates, counts, placeholders) |
| `gold`, `gold-rgb` | **the accent** — brand, active tab, primary buttons, tints |
| `accent` | brighter accent (focus rings, slider/hover highlights) |
| `on-accent` | text/icon **on** an accent-filled surface (near-black on gold) |
| `brand-fg`, `brand-fg-2` | wordmark base color (big / quieter-beside-emblem) |
| `red`, `red-rgb` | video / destructive / delete |
| `blue` | links |
| `green` | the "status/글" type accent |
| `rad`, `rad-pill` | corner roundness (cards / pills) |
| `font-base` | UI + body font stack |
| `font-display` | brand + calendar-title display font stack |

> A minimal "accent-only" theme overrides just `gold` + `gold-rgb` + `accent` +
> `on-accent` (+ a tuned `brand-fg`). Because tints use `var(--gold-rgb)`, the
> whole accent system — solids **and** tints — recolors coherently from those
> four values. The shipped brand/image themes go further and also retune the
> surfaces (`bg`/`bg2`/`bg3`/`line`) to sit in the palette's hue.

## Add / author a theme

1. Copy `00-default.json` to `NN-<name>.json` (pick `NN` for its cycle slot).
2. Change the tokens you want; delete the ones you keep at default (optional).
3. Reload — `home()` re-scans per request, so it's in the 🎨 cycle immediately.
4. Pick it with 🎨. To make it the default, name it to sort first.

**Contrast:** keep `on-accent` dark enough to read on the accent color, and
`txt`/`dim`/`faint` legible on `bg`.

---

## Light themes

Light themes are fully supported. The stylesheet routes **every** surface, text,
border and tint through tokens (`--sunken`/`--line2` cover the deep wells and
strong borders; `--blue-rgb`/`--green-rgb` cover the semantic tints), so a light
theme just needs to set light surfaces + dark text. The shipped `01`–`05` are
light. When authoring one:

- set `bg`/`bg2`/`bg3`/`sunken` light, `line`/`line2` to light greys;
- set `txt`/`fg`/`dim`/`faint` dark, and **`fg-bright` to near-black** (it's the
  strongest text, white only on dark themes);
- set **`hi-rgb: 0,0,0`** so faint overlays (even-row tint, etc.) darken;
- keep `shadow-rgb: 0,0,0` (shadows are dark on any background);
- pick `on-accent` to read on the accent (white on saturated blue/red/purple,
  near-black on a light/orange accent).
